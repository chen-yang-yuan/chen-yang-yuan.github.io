<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi :), I am Chenyang Yuan, a first year PhD student in Biostatistics at <a href="https://www.emory.edu/">Emory University</a>. I am interested in research topics related to statistical genetics and genomics. Prior to joining Emory, I received my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en/">the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)</a> in 2022.</p>
<p>Starting from June 2021, I have been working with <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/69">Prof. Tianwei Yu</a> and <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/331">Prof. Jicong Fan</a> at CUHK-Shenzhen on a project related to single-cell clustering. I am currently serving as a research assistant at <a href="https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/bios/faculty/teng-yong.html">Dr. Yong Teng</a>'s lab at <a href="https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/">Winship Cancer Institute</a> of Emory University, and I am conducting bioinformatic analysis on various cancer data.</p>
<p>I served as an undergraduate student teaching fellow at CUHK-Shenzhen. I launched tutorials for the course STA4003: Time Series in Spring 2022. <a href="teaching.html">Here</a> are my typeset and annotated notes.</p>

Parity-check Monomial Codes&rsquo; has been accepted as poster by ISTC 2021. The work is conducted during my internship at Huawei Technologies with Zihan Tang and Bin Li.</p>
</li>
<li><p>21/6/19 I am joining UofT as a research intern, supervised by Prof. Stark Draper.</p>
